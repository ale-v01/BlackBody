# BlackBody
This program calculates the correction factors needed to amplify the solar spectra, "32ms #1 High Cloud Cover.txt", at the right heights due to instrumentation error.
The correction factors are calculated by taking the ratio of an experimental blackbody and an ideal blackbody curve given by Planck's equation.
